# Multi-Clipboard

Multi-Clipboard is a tool that can be used to save an unlimited number of clipboards using the command line. You can choose to download the executable MultiClipboard.exe and run that or download the java file and compile yourself in the command line.

# Future
- The ability to save clipboards to a json file. All that are currently being stored
- The ability to then load these clipboards to the application

# How to compile a java file in cmd
*I know this is quite basic but would've helped me when I was learning*  
1. First open cmd in the same directory that MultiClipboard.java is saved in.
2. Make sure you have JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed
3. Then type the following 
```
javac MultiClipboard.java

java MultiClipboard
```
This should run the MultiClipboard program in the command line window you're in. Once compiled once you won't need to recompile unless you want to make edits. :)

# Cloning the directory
1. Make sure git is installed on your machine
2. Open cmd in the directory you would like to clone it
3. Type the following
```
git clone https://github.com/RiceDope/Multi-Clipboard.git
```

# Other info
- Any issues please let me know im happy to look to fix
- Feel free to use the code in any way you want
- Big thanks to the JD project (https://java-decompiler.github.io/) they saved me when I  was working on this. Somehow I managed to corrupt my whole java file and the software worked brilliantly to help me decompile the .jar file I had.
- Additionally I used Launch4j (https://launch4j.sourceforge.net/) to convert to a .exe file and this also worked well and I would suggest both of these programs.

*This is a small project for fun. Don't imagine any people will see it or use it. But if you do thanks.*
